# Step Trailing Stop

This code is a sample implementation of a step trailing stop in MQL5. It allows for the dynamic movement of the stop loss level based on a specified step size.

## Input Parameters

- StepSize: Specifies the step size for moving the stop loss. The default value is 10.0.

## How It Works

The code is executed on every tick. It retrieves the current stop loss level and calculates the price movement since the stop loss was last set. If the price movement exceeds the specified step size, the code calculates the number of steps required and updates the stop loss level accordingly.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Retrieve the current stop loss level using the `OrderGetDouble` function.
2. Calculate the price movement by subtracting the current stop loss level from the current bid price.
3. Check if the price movement exceeds the specified step size.
4. If the price movement exceeds the step size, calculate the number of steps required by dividing the price movement by the step size.
5. Calculate the new stop loss level by subtracting the product of steps, step size, and the symbol point from the current bid price.
6. Compare the new stop loss level with the current one.
7. If the new stop loss level is different, modify the stop loss level using the `OrderModify` function.
